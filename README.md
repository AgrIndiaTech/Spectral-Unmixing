## HyperspecAE
## WORK IN PROGRESS
This repository contains the pytorch implementation for the paper: [Hyperspectral Unmixing Using a Neural Network Autoencoder](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8322133) (Palsson et al. 2018). As a POC, the dataloaders and parameters corresponding to experiments on the Samson dataset are presented. 

## Datasets
The datasets used in the paper are publicly available and can be found [here](https://rslab.ut.ac.ir/data).

# TO DO
- Results and Model Description
- Add shell script for command line arguments
- Add instructions to run the code
